## Course Information

**Taught by:** Bill Laboon

**Room**: 157 Benedum Hall

**Time**: Fridays 1:00 - 1:50 (internship and research), 1:00 - 2:50 (project and project studio)

**Instructor's Office Hours:**
  * Room: 6305 Sennott Square
  * Tuesdays 1:30 - 4:30 PM (except first week)
  * or by appointment.

_NOTE: You will also be meeting with the customer with whom you are working or one of their representatives._

Attendance during presentations is **REQUIRED**.  If you will miss a class, it must be cleared with me first unless it is an emergency.  In the event of an emergency, let me know as soon as possible.

All students submit paper on their internship or project, as well as give an approximately 5-10 minute presentation on what they have done.  

In general, the 1:00-1:50 section of the class will rotate between tech talks from industry and presentations from students.

Project students will also need to submit some other assignments, detailed below.

## Details on Project Development:

The goal of this course is to develop a project, from start to finish, using modern software engineering tools and techniques.  The final project should be _well-written, well-tested, and well-documented_.  

Unless dictated otherwise by the customer, work should be done using git and GitHub or GitLab.  Work should be done in a private repository, and I should be added as a collaborator (username is "laboon" on both sites).  Please sign up for a student developer pack (which includes free private repositories, along with other free software) here: https://education.github.com/pack

Unless dictated otherwise by the customer, the project will be developed using the Agile/Scrum software design methodology.  We will discuss this more in class.  One of the key tenets is that there is always some "working" version of the software, even if it does not include all of the features.  This means that at any point, you should have a working version of the software to show customers (and professors)!

We will consider every other class meeting the end of each sprint.  During this time, we will spend some time doing a retrospective in your groups - meeting for twenty minutes or so, in-person, to determine what went well with the last sprint and what could go better.  You will also come up with a plan for the next sprint.  Professor Laboon will be available at the end of each lecture to discuss the path forward with each group.

Since student schedules are often hard to reconcile, I recommend you use a chat application such as Slack to stay in touch with each other, even when you cannot meet in person.

As this is a capstone course, you are expected to be self-motivated and independent.  This may mean learning a new language, framework, architecture, etc.  Professional software engineers are often expected to learn these things independently, and you should be prepared to do so as well.  If you are unfamiliar with where to find training materials or information for a particular subject, you may discuss it with Professor Laboon, but the onus is entirely on you to learn anything additional you need to know to complete the project.
